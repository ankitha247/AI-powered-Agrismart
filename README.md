AI Powered AgriSmart

AI Powered AgriSmart is an intelligent agriculture web platform designed to assist farmers in making data-driven decisions. The system leverages Machine Learning and Deep Learning models to provide crop recommendations, crop yield predictions, and plant disease detection, helping improve productivity and reduce risk in farming.

🚀 Features

✅ Crop Recommendation System

Suggests the most suitable crops based on soil and environmental conditions.

Built using Random Forest Classifier for high prediction accuracy.

✅ Crop Yield Prediction

Predicts expected crop production to help farmers plan resources effectively.

Implemented using Random Forest Regressor.

✅ Plant Disease Detection

Detects diseases from plant images using Zero-Shot CLIP, a pretrained vision-language model.

Eliminates the need for large labeled datasets.

✅ Multilingual Support

Accessible in English, Hindi, and Kannada to improve usability for diverse farmers.

✅ User-Friendly Web Interface

Simple and intuitive UI designed for easy navigation.
